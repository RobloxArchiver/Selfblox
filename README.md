# About | Current Version: 0.1.1 Alpha

Selfbot like client for Roblox using Synapse X with WebSocket enabled and a WebSocket Server to take requests. Also I am aware this is useless, this is a learning experience for me/a personal project. I don't care what you think :)

If you need to find patch notes you can find them [Here!](PATCH_NOTES.md)

# Setup

Requirements: Node.js, NPM, WS Package.

Open a new commandline and if you haven't already run `npm install ws`

Once that is all done run `launch.bat` and you're done!

## Roadmap

Currently my goal is to add a few simple features, suggestions are always welcomed in the Discord Server though! A Roadmap will be worked out eventually.
