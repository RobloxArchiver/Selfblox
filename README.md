# 0.1.0 Alpha Release

It's official, today I can finally say I have done enough as to where I can release a working client! The features are lousy (2 actual, 4 in total) but hey! Now I can write a guide right?

> **Alpha 0.1.0 Update Notes**

* Patched Various Bugs.
* Made Server. (Made in JS)
* Added `help` Command. 
* Added `server` Command. (Allows Control of the server via 2nd, 3rd, and 4th arguments.)
* Added `server clear` Command. (Clears Server Console)
* Added `server close` Command. (Closes WebSocket and notifies server. This is gonna change in the future for sure!)

# About
Selfbot like client for Roblox using Synapse X with WebSocket enabled and a WebSocket Server to take requests. Also I am aware this is useless, this is a learning experience for me/a personal project. I don't care what you think :)

## Roadmap

Currently my goal is to add a few simple features, suggestions are always welcomed in the Discord Server though! A Roadmap will be worked out eventually.
