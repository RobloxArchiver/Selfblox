# Latest are at the top!

# 0.1.0 Alpha Release

It's official, today I can finally say I have done enough as to where I can release a working client! The features are lousy (2 actual, 4 in total) but hey! Now I can write a guide right?

* Patched Various Bugs.
* Made Server. (Made in JS)
* Added `help` Command. 
* Added `server` Command. (Allows Control of the server via 2nd, 3rd, and 4th arguments.)
* Added `server clear` Command. (Clears Server Console)
* Added `server close` Command. (Closes WebSocket and notifies server. This is gonna change in the future for sure!)
